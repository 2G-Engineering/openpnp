Running
=======

Mac
---
Open a Terminal window and run the openpnp.sh script from the directory this
file is in.

Windows
-------
Open a Command Prompt and run the openpnp.bat batch file from the directory
this file is in.

Linux
-----
Linux is not yet supported. If you need it right away, get in touch and let
me know.


Configuration
=============

Configuration files are created during the first run and are stored in
$HOME/.openpnp/. 

If you run into configuration problems, delete the files in that directory
and they will be recreated.

Development
===========

OpenPnP builds with Maven. There is an included pom.xml that should build
the project and will build a proper Eclipse project using the command
mvn eclipse:eclipse
