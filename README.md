# OpenPnP

Open Source SMT Pick and Place Hardware and Software

## Introduction

OpenPnP is a project to create the plans, prototype and software for a completely Open Source SMT
pick and place machine that anyone can afford. I believe that with the ubiquity of cheap, precise
motion control hardware, some ingenuity and plenty of Open Source software it should be possible
to build and own a fully functional SMT pick and place machine for under $1000.

## Project Status

Overall, the project is in a pre-alpha state. This means that it's under heavy development and
there are currently no end-user usable components. We are working hard towards an initial alpha release.

If you would like to keep up with our progress you can
[Watch this project on GitHub](http://github.com/openpnp/openpnp), check out
[our Twitter](http://twitter.com/openpnp), [join the discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/openpnp),
or come chat with us on Freenode IRC at #openpnp. If you don't have an IRC client,

## Branches

The primary branches of interest in this project are master and develop. master is considered stable
and develop is the current development branch. Regular updates are made to develop and may cause
breaking changes. When it's considered stable it's merged to master. If you are planning to do any
development or integration you should probably use the develop branch.

## Components

There are three primary components of OpenPnP. They are the hardware, the firmware and the software. Currently the software is the primary area of development.

Further information for each can be found in their respective directories of [hardware](hardware), [firmware](firmware), and [gui](gui).

## Developers

If you'd like to be involved in the development of OpenPnP, please
